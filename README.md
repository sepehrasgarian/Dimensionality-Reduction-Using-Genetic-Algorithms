feature extraction using Genetic Algorithm 
 
Feature projection (also called Feature extraction) transforms the data in the high-dimensional space to a space of fewer dimensions. The data transformation may be linear, as in principal component analysis (PCA). In this project Feature Extraction is performed by Genetic Algorithm. In this [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/bestmind/how-to-make-your-auc-equals-1/data ) Genetic Algorithm finds the best features for reducing dimensionality .


To implement this project this article helped me a lot -> Dimensionality Reduction Using Genetic Algorithms by (Michael L. Raymer, William F. Punch, Erik D. Goodman, Leslie A. Kuhn, and Anil K. Jain)

For fitness function Gaussian na√Øve bayes is used in order to find fitness for each population.

I used [this toolbox for implementing Genetic Algorithm ](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/api/algo.html) for implementing Genetic Algorithm.
