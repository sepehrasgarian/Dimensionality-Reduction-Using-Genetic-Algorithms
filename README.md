feature extraction using Genetic Algorithm 
 
Feature projection (also called Feature extraction) transforms the data in the high-dimensional space to a space of fewer dimensions. The data transformation may be linear, as in principal component analysis (PCA). In this project Feature Extraction is performed by Genetic Algorithm. In this [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/bestmind/how-to-make-your-auc-equals-1/data ) Genetic Algorithm finds the best features for reducing dimensionality .


To implement this project this article helped me a lot -> Dimensionality Reduction Using Genetic Algorithms by (Michael L. Raymer, William F. Punch, Erik D. Goodman, Leslie A. Kuhn, and Anil K. Jain)

For fitness function Gaussian naïve bayes is used in order to find fitness for each population.

I used [this toolbox for implementing Genetic Algorithm ](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/api/algo.html) for implementing Genetic Algorithm.
